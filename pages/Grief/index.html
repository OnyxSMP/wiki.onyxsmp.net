			<h1>Grief</h1>
            <p>Grief has proved to be a big problem on the server, so on 6/23/22 we had a call with players to find a better solution, and here are the things we all came up with and added.</p><br>
			<h2>Trade Shops</h2>
			<p>A big problem has been stealing from chests in shops, so to combat this we're adding Trade Chest Shops.</p><br>
			<p>To make one, place a sign with the first line being "[Trade]".</p><br>
			<p>Then, to add content to the shop, run /ts setcost [item] [ammount] to set the cost.</p><br>
			<p>To add the product, do /ts setproduct [item] [ammount].</p><br>
			<p><strong>One important thing to note:</strong> Because of the way OnyxPack custom items work, they're not listed as Minecraft Items. So if you run /setcost or /setproduct WITHOUT ANY ARGUMENTS, it will set the product/cost to whatever you were holding.</p>
			<h2>Chest Locking</h2>
			<p>Stealing from personal chests have also become a problem, so we added the ability to lock your chests.</p><br>
			<p>To lock a chest, run /cprivate [players]</p><br>
			<p>Insert however many players you want to be able to access the chest.</p>
			<p>There are other methods of locking chests, see <a href="https://github.com/pop4959/LWCX/wiki/Getting-Started">here for more.</a></p>
			<h2>WorldGuard Protection</h2>
			<p>If you own a large base/kingdom and would like to protect it from things like TNT Explosions. Feel free to open a Ticket in the Discord and talk to staff about getting it WorldGuarded.</p>
